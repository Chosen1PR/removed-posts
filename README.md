## Features

This app locks posts automatically when they are removed by a moderator or deleted by the poster. Additionally, mods can:

- Enable or disable post locking at will without needing to uninstall the app.
- Optionally unlock posts when they are approved by any mod.
- Optionally ignore posts removed by AutoModerator.
- Define a blocklist of mods. Posts removed by these mods will not be locked automatically.
- Define an allowlist of mods (which overrides the blocklist) if only posts removed by certain mods should be locked.
- Optionally remove all comments for posts marked as spam.
